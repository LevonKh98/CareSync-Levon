# CareSync â€“ Healthcare Appointment System

## Overview
CareSync is a **full-stack healthcare appointment and records management system** designed to streamline patient scheduling, record management, and administrative workflows. The platform uses **role-based access control (RBAC)** to differentiate features for staff, doctors, and administrators, ensuring data security and proper access management.

This project was built as part of a **team university project**. It was developed locally and later uploaded to GitHub, which is why the **contribution graph does not reflect the full development timeline**.

## My Contributions
As part of the development team, I worked on:
- Designing and implementing **backend REST APIs** for appointments and patient data.
- **Database design and integration** with AWS RDS (MySQL).
- Developing **appointment scheduling logic**, including validations for time conflicts and business rules.
- Building **frontend components** for appointment forms and patient lookup.
- Collaborating on **UI improvements** and implementing form validation for better user experience.

## Future Improvements
- Implement **analytics dashboard** for administrators (e.g., appointment trends).
- Expand the system to include **billing and insurance modules**.
- Add **real-time chat** between patients and doctors.
